## 🎯 About Me

I'm actively transitioning into IT with CompTIA Network+, Security+, and Cloud+ certifications. My goal is to build a strong portfolio and apply for entry-level IT roles in Langkawi or remote positions. I love using analogies and visuals to teach others while reinforcing my own learning.

## 📬 Let’s Connect

I'm open to freelance, volunteer, and remote IT opportunities — especially in hospitality, retail, tourism, and education sectors.
